# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 

During the module assignments, we used SQL to clean and analyze employee data. This was done by making tables, importing data, and filtering/cleaning the data. The purpose of the challenge was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program


## Results 

1) About 90,398 (30.13%) employees are eligable for retirement. 
2) Before filtering through duplicates, employees eligable for retirment reached 133,776. 
3) The largest eligibility for retirement lies in senior engineers and senior staff positions. These roles will need to start to be filled first.

 4) Managers have lowest eligibility, holding only two individuals up for retirement.

## Summary 

Questions:
How many roles will need to fulfilled in order for the company not feel the impact of the upcoming retirment "silver tsunami"?
What roles need are of the upmost importance to be filled first?
Do we have enough qualified and retirement ready workers to help in mentoring the next generation of workers for each department?

Additional Queries: 
You can run a query only looking at higher positions that may be best suited to help train the new generation of workers. Additionally, a query looking at the detailed breakdown of each department will be beneficial to see how many roles need to filled in upcoming years.
